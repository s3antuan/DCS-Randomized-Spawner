# DCS-Randomized-Spawner

A script to set in advance and control during mission the spawning of AI units with randomized route and template for DCS world. 

This script is written based on [MOOSE](https://github.com/FlightControl-Master/MOOSE).


## Abstract

This script is designed for event mission hosts to easily setup the spawners before the mission and make setting changes on the spawners via F10 menu during the mission.

This script comes with two types of spawner: **RepeatingSpawner** and **OnetimeSpawner**. 
**RepeatingSpawner** is used when you want AI units repeatedly spawn into the map at a given time interval. You can also spawn one group to instantly using F10 menu.
